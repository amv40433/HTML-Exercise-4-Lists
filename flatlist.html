<h1 style="margin: 25px; font-size: 75px;"> <strong>Flat Lists</strong></h1>
<p style="font-size: 25px; margin: 25px;">
Reate four lists using the following information about planets.
The instructions for each list will introduce the list.
You'll need to put paragraph tags around the instructions (like this paragraph).
A reminder about the paragraph tag:
the only tags that can go inside a paragraph tag are tags the generate content "in the flow of text."
So your list can't go inside a paragraph.
Any introductory or labeling text needs to be in its own paragraph that ends before the list begins.
